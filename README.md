# Battletoads in Battlemaniacs - Restoration Project

This project aims to restore most of the missing content of the Master System version of Battletoads in Battlemaniacs (or just Battlemaniacs) to make it more like the original SNES version of Battletoads in Battlemaniacs.

[Battlemaniacs for the Master System](http://www.smspower.org/Games/Battlemaniacs-SMS) is an unfinished port of [Battletoads in Battlemaniacs for the SNES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battletoads_in_Battlemaniacs), which was developed by [Rare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_(company)) and published by [Tradewest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradewest). The Master System port was licensed by [Virgin Interactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Interactive), and development was tasked to [Syrox Developments](https://segaretro.org/Syrox_Developments). Virgin intended to release the game in Europe in mid 1994, copies were even sent to several gaming magazines which printed reviews, but the release was cancelled at the last minute. [Tec Toy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectoy) rescued the shelved port in 1996 for a Brazilian release through an agreement with Virgin (this also included another shelved game by Virgin, the [Master System port of Fire & Ice](http://www.smspower.org/Games/FireAndIce-SMS)). However, despite being a game which can be completed, the Master System port of Battletoads in Battlemaniacs was left in an unfinished/unpolished state with several aspects remaining either in placeholder or missing state. 

This project intends to restore most of the missing content by rewriting both the music/sound engine (which was converted to [PSGlib](https://github.com/sverx/PSGlib)) and the game opening/ending/intermission screen code to allow the addition of new content in these fields.

The main aims of the project are:

1. Restore all the missing game music.

2. Restore the incomplete intro and the missing ending sequence.

3. Restore all the SNES messages for the intermission scenes.

4. Restore artworks from the SNES version.

5. Some other minor fixes/additions.

At the moment the project does not intend to modify the level themselves, despite the overall feeling that some of them are unpolished/unfinished compared to the original SNES game. However, that possibility is not completely discarded, and anyone interested in investigating that and making it possible will be welcomed.
